# This is an example of a CODEOWNERS file

# Default owners for everything in the repo
*       @default-owner

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.

# To specify code owners for a specific directory
/docs/          @documentation-team

# To specify code owners for a specific file type
*.js            @javascript-team

# To specify code owners for specific files
/README.md      @project-lead

# You can also use email addresses if they are associated with a GitHub account
/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md    user@example.com

# Using teams in an organization (syntax: org/team_name)
/tests/         @myorg/testing-team

# To specify code owners for nested directories, use the '**' pattern
/src/**/test/   @testing-team

# Exclude specific files or directories by preceding with an exclamation mark (!)
# Note: Exclusion patterns are not supported by GitHub's CODEOWNERS file as of the last update.
